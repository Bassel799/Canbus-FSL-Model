In automotive environments, Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus systems enable crucial communication between Electronic Control Units (ECUs), handling everything from braking systems to engine controls. These networks were first created without integrated security frameworks \cite{batista2023lococat}, making them extremely susceptible to cybersecurity risks like replay, flooding, and spoofing attacks. Vehicle safety, dependability, and operational integrity can all be seriously jeopardized by any of these attacks. Because actual attack events are prevalent, unpredictable, and dangerous, there is a critical need for a rapid and reliable way to identify these threats as they emerge. Classical supervised learning approaches are often too slow and data-hungry to adapt in real time or in data-scarce environments, making them impractical for timely in-vehicle deployment. By significantly lowering data dependency and attaining superior predictive performance, this study suggests Few-Shot Learning (FSL) approaches, particularly utilizing Prototypical Networks with episodic training \cite{sicara2023easyfsl}, as an inventive remedy for these issues.
