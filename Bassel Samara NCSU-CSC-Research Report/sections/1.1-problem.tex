\subsection{Problem Statement}
\label{subcsec:problem}

The problem is that Controller Area Network (CAN) Bus systems are susceptible to cyberattacks, and it is difficult to classify these attacks using conventional supervised learning techniques, which necessitate large labeled datasets that are frequently unavailable because real-world attacks are unpredictable and infrequent. This calls for a real-time system that can reliably categorize attacks using a small amount of labeled data.
